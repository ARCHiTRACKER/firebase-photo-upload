    "description_short": "Burlington Gate is made up of apartments and galleries, as well as a new public space in the form of an arcade that runs from Old Burlington Street to Cork Street. Not only does this project enhance the experience of London’s most established art gallery district, it also re-establishes the character of the Georgian streetscape with a contemporary building of the highest architectural quality.",
    "description_long": "The development is in the heart of Mayfair close to the Royal Academy and Burlington Arcade. The area was developed most extensively during the 18th Century and is typified by a hierarchy of streets and squares framed by close grained Georgian architecture. Successive eras of development have taken place and the area now has a great variety of architectural styles and scales.\r\n\r\nRSHP’s design has evolved through an analysis of the immediate and wider context, which has resulted in a sensitive scheme that responds to the height, scale and urban grain of its surroundings and provides a positive contribution to the streetscape of Old Burlington Street and Cork Street. The development comprises two linear buildings connected by a single translucent core that allows light into the heart of the scheme. The street facades are expressed in a series of bays in proportion to the nearby townhouses, restoring the prevalent urban grain. Inside, apartments are arranged so that the living areas face the streets and bedrooms face the internal light well, taking advantage of daylight as much as possible. At the upper levels, the façade is inclined and this setback responds to the surrounding roofscapes.\r\n\r\nThe materials for this project have been carefully selected to reflect the architectural heritage of the area. The main structural frame will be made up of high-quality reinforced concrete that contains a high proportion of crushed granite, basalt and mica aggregate. This dark background is broken up by a series of light stainless steel frames and matches the colour contrast of the surrounding brick facades with their white window frames. These stainless steel elements surround either windows or solid panels made up of handmade bricks, referring to the subtle modelling on the adjacent building exteriors.",

    "description_short": "Located on the Albert Embankment of London’s River Thames, opposite the Tate Britain and within sight of the Houses of Parliament, Merano offers a high quality, mixed-use development, including apartments, offices and a café. The three stepped bays that make up the building are in contrast to the existing monotonous ‘wall’ of dilapidated developments that occupy this area.",
    "description_long": "At the base of the building, a four-storey public space offers access through to Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens via Tinworth Street and to a café at ground floor level. The height of this public space echoes that of the neighbouring Rose pub a local landmark and part of the Albert Embankment conservation area. The design has a strong visual presence along the riverfront and acts as a gateway to east Lambeth as well as a natural gathering space overlooking Albert Embankment Gardens.\r\n\r\nThe east–west orientation of the site dictated the layout of the apartments. By placing the vertical circulation core in the centre of the eastern elevation, bedrooms and winter gardens can be placed either side of it to benefit from morning sunlight and living spaces, on the western side of the building, can enjoy views of the river and sunsets in the evening. The different uses of space within the building are arranged vertically: commercial office spaces occupy the three floors above the café and public piazza and 46 dwellings (a mix of private and affordable units) take up the upper levels.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the building is a simple concrete frame with steel bracing used to provide stability. This allows for the east and west façades to be primarily glass, creating a lightweight, transparent envelope, and enables open and flexible floor plates. Balconies and winter gardens are formed of a lightweight steel structure with colour applied to the soffits and flank walls, which brighten the exterior in contrast to the building’s monochromatic surroundings.",

The building comprises 103 apartments with one,two,three and four-bed units (including roof-top penthouses) ranging from 93 m² to 232 m². The site also provides parking spaces for 170 cars and integral leisure facilities.\n\nThe diagonal alignment creates a landscaped setting for St Mary’s Church within a new public park. Views of the church have been enhanced and the river walk extended through the site forming a continuous route between Wandsworth and Battersea bridges. Aligned on a north-south axis overlooking the River Thames, the apartments are organised into five connected blocks, stepping up towards the river away from St. Mary’s Church from four to 20 storeys, ensuring that all flats enjoy river views to the west. The blocks are connected by four distinct lift towers providing rhythm to the east façade and access to all of the apartments, avoiding the need for corridors. Access to the building, as well as to residents’ car parking and a leisure centre, are located to the east of the building. The west façade is punctuated by balconies accessed from living areas and kitchens.",

    "description_short": "This residential scheme lies in the heart of the Bankside area of London, located close to the River Thames and directly opposite the west entrance to Tate Modern and its new extension. NEO Bankside comprises 217 residential units in four buildings ranging from 12 to 24 storeys. These four hexagonal pavilions have been arranged to provide residents with generous accommodation, stunning views and maximum daylight. The steel and glass pavilions take their cues from the immediate context.",
    "description_long": "A generous public realm is created which is animated by retail at ground level. Landscaped groves define two clear public routes through the site which extend the existing landscape from the riverside gardens outside Tate Modern through to Southwark Street and will act as a catalyst for creating a lively and vibrant environment around the base of the buildings throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe overall design hints at the former industrial heritage of the area during the 19th and 20th centuries, responding in a contemporary language which reinterprets the colouration and materials of the local architectural character. The oxide reds of the Winter Gardens echo those of Tate Modern and nearby Blackfriars Bridge, while the exterior’s timber clad panels and window louvres give the building a warm, residential feeling.\r\n\r\nThe pavilions’ distinctive external bracing system has removed the need for internal structural walls and created highly flexible spaces inside the apartments. Located outside of the cladding plane as a distinct and legible system the bracing gives a greater richness and depth to the façade and provides a scaling device which helps unify the micro scale of the cladding with the macro scale of the buildings. Interestingly, the dramatic appearance of the bracing and nodes has become a selling point, with many buyers requesting apartments with nodes outside their windows.\r\n\r\nWinter gardens are enclosed, single-glazed balconies at the north and south ends of each building, suspended from the main structure on a lightweight deck with large sliding screens. They act both as enclosed terraces and additions to the interior living space. The gardens effectively create ‘prows’ and are expressed as exposed steel decks suspended from the main floor plates on a system of props and hangers. Glazed lift towers provide all occupants with great views of London and the river, and a dynamic expression of the vertical circulation on the eastern side of each building.",

Once inside the building these views are maintained from a series of fully-glazed circulation cores incorporating stairs, lifts and lobbies. One Hyde Park comprises 86 apartments and duplexes (including four penthouses) plus three retail units at ground floor level fronting onto Knightsbridge. Additional facilities for residents include: a private cinema; a 21m swimming pool; squash courts; gym; and a business suite with meeting rooms.",
    "description_long": "The design seeks to complement the existing streetscape of Knightsbridge and create a scheme that offers daylight and generous views whilst achieving the necessary degree of privacy for its occupants. As befits luxury apartments, elegant detailing and quality of construction were of great importance. Materials were chosen to reflect the colouring and texture of the surrounding buildings: red-brown copper alloy façades complement the surrounding red brick buildings; and pale structural concrete mimics stone details on the neighbouring Mandarin Oriental Hotel.\r\n\r\nA new gateway to the Park has been created by relocating Edinburgh Gate to the western edge of the site. The roadway is covered by a canopy and the top surface is planted to provide a visual amenity for all those overlooking it and protect residents from traffic noise. Epstein’s ‘Pan’ which was at the northern end of the existing Edinburgh Gate has been repositioned to maintain its relationship to the new roadway.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern edge of the site, linking the Park to Knightsbridge, a new pedestrian route through the site, Serpentine Walk, has been created. The original Knightsbridge underground station entrance has been relocated adjacent to Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The entrance was designed using a similar palette of materials to those used in One Hyde Park creating a structure with a glazed roof and walls that appears to be both open and solid.\r\n\r\nRenowned lighting artist, James Turrell has created a unified lighting concept that interacts with the development’s architecture. It includes perimeter lighting for the five glass stair and lift structures and a colourful light display.",
